  Thanks for stopping by! Over the past 25 years, the work has spanned eCommerce, Telecom, EdTech, and Fintech, always focused on one thing: building products that matter and helping teams scale them successfully.
  
  Based in Chennai, India, the sweet spot has been taking ideas from zero to launch, then growing them rapidly while modernizing platforms and championing DevOps culture. Whether it's leading a team through Digital Transformation or getting hands-on with AWS/Azure architecture, the approach stays the same: build it right, build it fast, build it together.
  
  Continuous learning drives everything here. You will find ongoing POCs, MVPs, and experiments because for me the best way to understand something is to build it. Along the way, there have been a couple of patents and six years as a Microsoft MVP in .NET and SQL Server, but those are just milestones in a much longer journey.
  
  This space is for sharing what works, what doesn't, and what's being learned along the way. Always happy to connect, collaborate, or just talk tech!
