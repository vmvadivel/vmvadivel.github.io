bio: |
  Thanks for stopping by. My journey started 25 years ago wtih a simple goal: building products that matter. From eCommerce, Telecom, EdTech to FinTech, that passion has never changed, only the tools have.
  
  These days, I am exploring AI and Generative AI to see how they can make product development smarter and faster. Combine that with Cloud platforms like AWS and Azure and a strong DevOps mindset, and the possibilities are endless.
  
  I love taking ideas from zero to launch, scaling them fast, and experimenting along the way. You will see POCs, MVPs, and lessons learned here because for me, the best way to understand something is to build it. Along the way, there have been a couple of patents and six years as a Microsoft MVP in .NET and SQL Server, but those are just milestones in a much longer journey.
  
  This space is for sharing what works, what doesn't, and what's being learned along the way. Always happy to connect, collaborate, or just talk tech!
