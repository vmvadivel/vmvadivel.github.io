- title: "NotesBuddy"
  description: "NotesBuddy began as a COVID lockdown side project to learn Android development hands-on. The goal: build a simple, intuitive notes app for organising thoughts effortlessly. Within months, it was desiged, developed, and published on Google Play, teaching me the full Android lifecycle: design, development, publishing, secure key management (hard lesson!), and rapid prototyping under constraints. Though retired after losing signing keys, NotesBuddy remains a milestone and a reminder that that best way to learn is by building."
