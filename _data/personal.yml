bio: |
  Thanks for visiting. I'm a Tech Executive and hands-on leader with over 25 years of experience in engineering and operations across diverse sectors like EdTech, Fintech, and Telecom.
  
  My professional life has been dedicated to two things: building and scaling. I specialize in taking software products from 0 to 1 and rapidly growing them to meet business goals, all while modernizing platforms and fostering a strong DevOps culture.
  
  I believe in continuous learning, which is why I'm always tackling personal challenges by creating POCs and MVPs. I also value leading high-performing teams through Digital Transformation and Cloud strategy (AWS/Azure).
  
  I'm a co-inventor on a couple of patents and a six-time Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) in .NET and SQL Server.
  
  I'm here to share my journey and connect.
